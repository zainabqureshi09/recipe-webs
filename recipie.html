            <h2>This Chocolate Cake Is:</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Incredibly moist.</li>
                    <li>Made with 2 layers, but can easily be adapted for 3 layers or baked as a sheet cake.</li>
                    <li>Soft with a velvety, tender crumb.</li>
                    <li>Packed with rich, deep chocolate flavor.</li>
                    <li>Decadently indulgent, similar to my flourless chocolate cake.</li>
                    <li>Finished with a smooth, creamy chocolate buttercream</li>

        <h1>
            Key Ingredients & Why They Matter
        </h1>
        <p>Each ingredient plays a crucial role in creating the perfect chocolate cake. For the best results, avoid substitutions.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">All-Purpose Flour:</h2>
    <p>Provides structure to the cake. Unlike in a confetti cake, cake flour is too fine here, especially when paired with light cocoa powder—stick to all-purpose flour for the right texture.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Unsweetened Natural Cocoa Powder:</h2>
    <p>Use natural cocoa powder, not Dutch-process. For a deeper dive into the differences, see the guide on Dutch-process vs natural cocoa powder.
        Baking Soda & Baking Powder: Both are used for lift. If you need a refresher on the difference between baking soda and baking powder, it's good to know we need both here.
        Salt: Enhances and balances the flavors in the cake.</p>
     <h2 style="text-align: left;">Espresso Powder (Optional):</h2>
     <p> Highly recommended! It amplifies the chocolate flavor without adding a coffee taste. I also use it in my chocolate zucchini cake, Guinness cake, chocolate raspberry cake, and marble loaf cake.</p>
     <h2 style="text-align: left;">Oil:</h2>
     <p> Unlike butter, oil adds the necessary moisture to balance the drying effects of cocoa powder. This is essential for achieving that moist crumb, as seen in my chocolate cake roll recipe.</p>
     <h2 style="text-align: left;">Eggs:</h2>
     <p>Use two room temperature eggs. To bring cold eggs to room temperature quickly, place them in a cup of warm water for about 10 minutes. Ingredient temperature greatly impacts the success of your cake—use room temperature ingredients unless specified otherwise.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Buttermilk: </h2>
    <p>The acidity and moisture from buttermilk are essential. Lately, Ihave been combining sour cream with buttermilk and reducing the hot liquid slightly. Check out my dark chocolate mousse cake, tuxedo cake, black forest cake, German chocolate cake, and chocolate peanut butter cake for variations.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Vanilla Extract: </h2>
    <p> Adds depth and enhances the overall flavor.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Hot Coffee or Hot Water:</h2>
    <p>Hot liquid helps bloom the cocoa powder, ensuring a richer, more intense chocolate flavor. While I don’t use hot liquid in my chocolate cupcake recipe (due to smaller quantities of dry ingredients), it’s necessary for this cake. If you prefer not to use coffee, hot water works fine, but coffee deepens the flavor. Decaf is a great option if you're avoiding caffeine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Cake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups (219g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>¾ cup (62g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder
        </li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups (350g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional, but recommended)</li>
        <li>½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil, canola oil, or melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee, regular or decaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Chocolate Buttercream</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups (282g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups (420g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch-process)</li>
        <li>3–5 tablespoons (45-75ml) heavy cream, half-and-half, or milk, room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Optional for decoration: semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instruction</h1>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line them with parchment paper rounds, and grease the parchment as well. Parchment paper ensures the cakes release easily from the pans. (For a guide, check out the video and post on parchment paper rounds for cakes.)</p>
    <br>
<p>Prepare the cake batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using). Set aside. In a separate bowl, using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or a regular whisk), mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla on medium-high speed until fully combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until well incorporated. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot coffee or water, and mix on low speed until the batter is smooth and well combined. The batter will be thin.</p>
<br>
<p>Divide and bake: Evenly divide the batter between the two prepared pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Baking times can vary, so keep an eye on the cakes. Once fully baked, the cakes may slightly sink in the center due to the moisture and structure of the cocoa powder—this is normal.</p>
<br>
<p>Cool the cakes: Remove the cakes from the oven and place them on a wire rack to cool completely in the pans.</p>
<br>
<p>Make the buttercream: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy (about 2 minutes). Add the confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 tablespoons of heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 minute. If the frosting is too thin, add ¼ cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder. If too thick, add 1-2 more tablespoons of cream. Taste the frosting and add a pinch of salt if needed.</p>
<br>
<p>Assemble and frost the cake: If the cakes have domed on top, use a serrated knife to level them by slicing off a thin layer. Place one cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate, spread an even layer of frosting over the top, and place the second layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining buttercream. Use an icing spatula and bench scraper for a smooth finish. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.</p>
<br>
<p>Chill and serve: Refrigerate the cake uncovered for 30-60 minutes to help it set before slicing. You can also refrigerate for up to 4-6 hours before serving. The cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.</p>
<br>
<p>Store leftovers: Cover the cake tightly and refrigerate for up to 5 days. A cake carrier is ideal for storing and transporting.</p>
